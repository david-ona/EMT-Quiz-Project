# EMT Quiz Project

## Overview
This project is designed as an interactive quiz for Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) or those studying to become EMTs. It aims to provide a useful tool for testing and reinforcing knowledge in the field of emergency medical care.

## Files in the Project
- `EMT_Quiz_Project_v2.py`: The main Python script that runs the quiz.
- `EMT_Quiz_Questions.json`: A JSON file containing a collection of multiple-choice questions related to EMT knowledge.

## How it Works

- Questions are presented in a random order to the user.
- For each question, the user is asked to choose the correct answer from the provided options.
- The script keeps track of the total number of questions answered and the number of correct responses.
